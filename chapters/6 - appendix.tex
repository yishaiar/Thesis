\chapter{Appendix}\label{chapter:Appendix}
Most of all, this dissertation is dedicated to my beloved family. My wife, Kelly,
has been extraordinarily supportive and has made countless sacrifices throughout the entire
process. My two children, Tom and Keren, have also motivated me to accomplish this
dissertation in a timely manner. I hope I have made you both proud. I wish to express my
sincere gratitude to my parents for their exceptional love and support. Their constant support for me and my progress during this entire journey have allowed me
to successfully complete this project. 
\par\noindent
I would like to express the deepest appreciation for my Ph.D. advisor, Professor Howell, for his continual supervision and valuable feedback. He
has provided me with insightful comments on my research that have been a substantial aid
in this accomplishment. Without his guidance and persistent support, I would never have
been able to complete my dissertation. Further, I extend my gratitude to the staff of the Hebrew University workshop headed by Avner for their assistance in designing and their careful manufacturing of the experiment components. I know that required a great deal of investment.

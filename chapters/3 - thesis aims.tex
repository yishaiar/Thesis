\section{Measurement Method}
The Cavendish experiment, is constructed using a torsional pendulum with a front mirror. The angle displaement is causing a mirror tilt. Optical measurement of angle displaement is made with a split detector. 
\par
Shot noise using a split detector in an interferometric technique is even on all frequencies. Shot limit when integrating over a long time.
\begin{equation}
\Delta\theta = \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2}\pi}\frac{\lambda}{L\sqrt{N}} \approx
4\cdot10^{-14} [\frac{rad}{Hz}]    \label{eqn:gravitation_tourqe}
\end{equation}
When the gravitational force is measured using a torsional pendulum, there are noise limitation to the measuremnt sensetivity. The limitation are higher than the shot noise limit, meaning that reducing the noise could achieve higher sensetivity. The noises on the pendulum are magnetic noise, random fluctuations due to thermal brownian motion and acoustic waves. Friction is also limiting the pendulum response. 
\par
Pendulum is placed inside vacuum reducing brownian motion, acoustic waves and friction, vacuum chamber is reducing magnetic noise by faraday cage. At vacuum the brownian motion from envirement coupling is highly reduced, enabling to compensate the system noises and cool the pendulum temperture.
\par
The system is cooled down by using radiation pressure force. Fast modulated high intensity light sources from both ends of pendulum are adding controled small fast changing damping tourqe. The damping is by using a PID feedback loop. The damping is by feedback, enabling to damp all unknown noises from system. 
\par
The system ossiclations become smaller enlarging the SNR and the measuremnt sensetivity. The PID error is getting samller and damping response becomes small. 
\begin{equation}
e(t) = \theta_{error}(t)   \label{eqn:pid_error}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
u(t) = K_Pe(t)+K_I\int_{0}^{t}e(t)+K_D\frac{de(t)}{dt}   \label{eqn:PID_eq}
\end{equation}

Introducing a new mass add a constant new tourqe to the system, which the PID is compensating. The PID response become a constant reverse tourqe. 
\begin{equation}
e(t) = \theta_{error}(t) + \theta_{gravity}(t)    \label{eqn:PID_measurement}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
u(t) = u[ \theta_{error}(t)] + K_P\theta_{gravity}(t) \approx K_P\theta_{gravity}(t)\label{eqn:PID_measurement_eq}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\kappa\theta_{gravity} =\frac{u(t)}{K_P} = L\frac{GmM}{r^2}    \label{eqn:pid_gravitation_tourqe}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\kappa =\frac{8\pi^2ml^2}{T^2}    \label{eqn:empirical_tourqe}
\end{equation}
The measurement of that response is fast and accurate. The measurement sytem is measuring with fast response (short integration time) and high accuracy low frequency garvity fields.

\chapter{introduction}\label{chp:example-1}

Gravitational field has a very unique nature compare to other fields. Gravitational field could not be shielded and the force could not be compensated. The Gravitational force is inverse to the square of the distance between the masses, causing a very weak force. Those properties makes it a dominating force in nature but very hard to measure at experiments.
\par
Since the invention of the first modern gravimeter, at 1936, gravimetry is used widely to exam matter properties or measure gravitational fields. Precision gravimetry \cite{Wahr04,Bingham10,Bell98,Leeuwen00,Diorio03,Romaides01,Peters01,Luther82,Kuroda95,Karagioz96,Bagley97,Gundlach00,Quinn01,Armstrong03,Kleinevoss99,Parks10,Peters99,Mcguirk02,Dimopoulos07,Lamporesi08,Sorrentino10,Rosi14,Goodkind99} is used at oil and gas exploration \cite{Bell98}, mining \cite{Leeuwen00}, mapping earth's local gravity \cite{Wahr04,Bingham10} and temporal geological shifts. Determining Newton's gravitational constant \cite{Luther82, Kuroda95, Karagioz96, Bagley97, Gundlach00, Quinn01, Armstrong03, Kleinevoss99, Parks10, Peters99, Mcguirk02, Dimopoulos07, Lamporesi08, Sorrentino10, Rosi14} and gravitational imaging systems. 

\par
Most gravimetric methods, rely on the Cavendish experiment, first performed in the 17th century. These measuring methods use a pendulum and measure the spectral density of the gravitational field. These methods have precision and accuracy limitations especialy at low frequencies. Significant effort has been undertaken to improve the measurement accuracy: torsion pendulum \cite{Luther82,Kuroda95,Karagioz96,Bagley97,Gundlach00,Quinn01,Armstrong03}, simple pendulum \cite {Kleinevoss99,Parks10} and atomic interferometry \cite{Lamporesi08,Sorrentino10,Rosi14}.

%Precision of the order of 1 $\mu$g to 1 nano-g is often used for mapping geological variations $(1 g = [9.8]m s^{-2} )$ .
Both relative and absolute measurements are employed. 
\par
A standard in the industry for absolute gravimetry is measuring interference fringes due to the free-fall of a corner cube in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a sensitivity of $100 nano-g Hz^{-1/2}$. Another competing gravimetric technology employs atomic interferometry achieving a resolution of 100 pico-g after two days of integration \cite{Peters01}. 
The field standard is a superconducting sphere suspended in the field of a superconducting coil achieving 3 pico-g resolution \cite{Goodkind99} after one month integration and 1 pico-g  after one year. 
The most sensitive device to date is Kasevich's 10 m atom interferometer which achieves 500 femto-g after one hour of integration \cite{PhysRevA.91.033629,kasevich2014prospects}. 
\par
In this work we propose to advance a new gravitational sensor, with high accuracy, especialy at low frequencies. The sensor is based on a torsional pendulum with an active noise removal using optical pressure. The sensor is a relative gravity sensor with an entirely optical readout, able to sense changes in gravitational fields around it.

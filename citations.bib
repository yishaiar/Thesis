abstract="We examine the results of the paper ``Precision metrology using weak measurements'' (Zhang et al.                   arXiv:1310.5302                                  , 2013) from a quantum state discrimination point of view. The Heisenberg scaling of the photon number for the precision of the interaction parameter between coherent light and a spin one-half particle (or pseudo-spin) has a simple interpretation in terms of the interaction rotating the quantum state to an orthogonal one. To achieve this scaling, the information must be extracted from the spin rather than from the coherent state of light, limiting the applications of the method to phenomena such as cross-phase modulation. We next investigate the effect of dephasing noise and show a rapid degradation of precision, in agreement with general results in the literature concerning Heisenberg scaling metrology. We also demonstrate that a von Neumann-type measurement interaction can display a similar effect with no system/meter entanglement.",

The effect is the photonic version of the spin Hall effect in electronic systems, indicating the universality of the effect for particles of different nature. Treating the effect as a weak measurement of the spin projection of the photons, we used a preselection and postselection technique on the spin state to enhance the original displacement by nearly four orders of magnitude, attaining sensitivity to displacements of \~{}1 angstrom. The spin Hall effect can be used for manipulating photonic angular momentum states, and the measurement technique holds promise for precision metrology.},

abstract = {We present an interferometric technique for measuring ultrasmall tilts. The information of a tilt in one of the mirrors of a modified Sagnac interferometer is carried by the phase difference between the counter-propagating laser beams. Using a small misalignment of the interferometer, orthogonal to the plane of the tilt, a bimodal (or two-fringe) pattern is induced in the beam's transverse power distribution. By tracking the mean of such a distribution, using a split detector, a sensitive measurement of the phase is performed. With 1.2mW of continuous-wave laser power, the technique has a shot noise limited sensitivity of 56  frad/Hz and a measured noise floor of 200  frad/Hz for tilt frequencies above 2Hz. A tilt of 200 frad corresponds to a differential displacement of 4.0fm in our setup. The novelty of the protocol relies on signal amplification due to the misalignment and on good performance at low frequencies. A noise floor of about 70  prad/Hz is observed between 2 and 100mHz.},

The amplitude of the annually varying signal can be determined to 1.0 cm. Results are 30\% better for a 1500 km smoothing radius, and 40\% worse for a 750 km radius. We estimate the annually varying component of water storage for three large drainage basins (the Mississippi, the Amazon, and a region draining into the Bay of Bengal), to accuracies of 1.0–1.5 cm.}

The difference between our value for g and one obtained by a falling corner-cube optical interferometer is (7 ± 7) × 10 −9 g . The atom interferometer uses velocity-selective stimulated Raman transitions and laser-cooled caesium atoms in an atomic fountain. We extend previous methods of analysing the interferometer to include the effects of a gravitational gradient. We also present detailed experimental and theoretical studies of potential systematic errors and noise sources.}

title="Noise suppression in inverse weak value-based phase detection",
journal="Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations",
year="2017",
month="Oct",
day="26",
abstract="We examine the effect of different sources of technical noise on inverse weak value-based precision phase measurements. We find that this type of measurement is similarly robust to technical noise as related experiments in the weak value regime. In particular, the measurements considered here are robust to additive Gaussian white noise and angular jitter noise commonly encountered in optical experiments. Additionally, we show the same techniques used for precision phase measurement can be used with the same technical advantages for optical frequency measurements.",

\emph{I dedicate my dissertation work to my family and many friends. A special
feeling of gratitude to my loving parents, William and Louise Johnson whose
words of encouragement and push for tenacity ring in my ears. My sisters Katie,
Linda and Rhonda have never left my side and are very special.
 I also dedicate this dissertation to my many friends and church family who have
supported me throughout the process. I will always appreciate all they have done,
especially Suquesta Myers for helping me develop my technology skills, LaTanja
Riley-Hedgepeth for the many hours of proofreading, and Ramona Taylor for
helping me to master the leader dots.
 I dedicate this work and give special thanks to my best friend Nelson L.
Jennings and my wonderful daughter Cimone for being there for me throughout the
entire doctorate program. Both of you have been my best cheerleaders.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Contributors and Funding Sources}  
Taken from \url{http://www.rochester.edu/Theses/}: ``In this section, name all members of the dissertation committee. Then, any collaboration with others in carrying out your dissertation research or in publications reflecting that research must be clearly described,
and your independent contributions must be made clear. The sources of financial support for your research 
must be listed. If you completed all the work independently without outside funding support, indicate this
here as well. \par
You may include as chapters or sections in the dissertation your own work that has been previously published
elsewhere, as long as that publisherâ€™s copyright permits, and as long as your contribution to multi-authored
work is made clear in this section. The dissertation will not be approved if any content is subject to
governmental or other restrictions that limit freedom of publication.''
